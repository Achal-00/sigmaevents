## Setting Up MongoDB

Setting up MongoDB is like creating a space to store all the event and user-related data. Don't worry; it's easy!
1. **Create MongoDB Atlas Account**: Sign up [here](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and make a cluster.
2. **Get API Key and Connection URL**: Get a special code (API key) and link (connection URL) for your database.
3. **Set Environment Variables**: Create a `.env.local` file and put in the special codes you received.

## Setting Up NextAuth with Google Console

NextAuth is a tool for handling logins. Here's how to set it up with Google:
1. **Create a Google Cloud Platform Project**: Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a project.
2. **Enable Google Authentication**: Click a few buttons in the console to set up Google login for your project.
3. **Get Client ID and Secret**: You'll get special codes (Client ID and Secret) for linking your NextAuth with Google.
